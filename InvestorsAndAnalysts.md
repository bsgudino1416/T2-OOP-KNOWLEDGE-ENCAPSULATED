### PROBLEM
We need a system that allows us to control inventory and sales prices in a tire store, since imbalances in profits and differences in product entry and exit records have been detected. To understand what the program needs to do, you first need to understand a little about inventory management, updating prices, and applying discounts and taxes. However, we will keep things simple and only deal with the recording of tire entries and exits, along with the calculation of final prices with discount and VAT included.
### SUMMARY 
In the commercial field, correct inventory management and price control is essential to maintain profitability and transparency in a store. Without automated monitoring, errors in price calculations, stock losses or inconsistencies in profits may occur. A system that records tire entries and exits, applies discounts and VAT automatically, and keeps the total inventory value up to date would allow managers to have exact control of stocks and profits generated, guaranteeing efficient and reliable management. of the business.
